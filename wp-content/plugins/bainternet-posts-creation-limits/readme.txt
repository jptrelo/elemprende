very simple and light wieght plugin that runs only when user tries to crate a new post of any kind (post,page,attachment,or any custom post type) and check if he has reached his limit.


**Main Feature:**

*	Limit number of any post type creation by user Role. (NEW)
*	Limit number of any post type creation by user ID. (NEW)
*	New Limit Rule System (faster and stable).
*	Custom blocked message For each Rule. (NEW)
*	MultiSite Support. (Fixed and works better then before)
*	ADD NEW Links are removed when limit is reached (NEW)
*	0 Now means ZERO so Its actually blocks the user from creating at all.

!! Do Not Try with admin user beacuse he is never limited unless you are on a multisite install and then the super admin is never limited.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have Found a Bug, Now what? =

Simply use the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/tags/bainternet-posts-creation-limits?forum_id=10\">Support Forum</a> and thanks a head for doing that.


= It's Not Working...? =

 Make sure you are not loged in as admin user or user with role that can manage options or on a multisite installation make sure you are not the super admin or a user with role that can manage network.

= How To Use in MultiSite =

 Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. (This is not created by default. You must create it in the wp-content folder.) The “mu” does not stand for multi-user like it did for WPMU, it stands for “must-use” as any code placed in that folder will run without needing to be activated. 
 After you define you settings in the main site it will apply to all sub sites, you can also have a site specific settings by entering that sites dashboard >> post creation limits panel and save the site specific rules.
 
= How To Use On FrontEnd Forms? =

 Just for that you can use the built in Shortcode. simply wrap your form with [IN_LIMIT] tags ex:
`[IN_LIMIT] form code here ... [/IN_LIMIT]`

 You can even use nested shortcodes ex:
`[IN_LIMIT] [form shortcode here] [/IN_LIMIT]`

= What are the Parameters of the Shortcode? =

`'message' => to overwrite rule message,
'm' => when a user is not logged in,
'use_m' => wheter to overwrite or not,
'type' => the post type that needs to be checked.`

ex:
`[IN_LIMIT use_m="true" message="no more pages for you", m="only looged in users can post here" type="page"] [form shortcode here] [/IN_LIMIT]`

= Any Filter Hooks? =
 
 Yes, many :)

`'bapl_shortcode_not_logged_in' -> log in message`
`'bapl_shortcode_network_admin' -> network admin on multisite`
`'bapl_shortcode_admin' -> admin on none multisite`
`'bapl_shortcode_limited' -> when a user is limited message`
`'bapl_shortcode_ok' -> when a user is ok to see the form`
`'post_creation_limits_limited_message_class' -> error class on backend when limited``



that's it so far.
