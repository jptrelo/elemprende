== Description ==

Collect and manage event registrations with a customizable form and email template. Whether you're holding a meetup, class, workshop, tournament, or any other kind of event, you need a way to handle registration. Our plugin makes managing this process easy and simple. Even nontechnical users can setup the plugin and start collecting registrations within minutes.

= Parent Plugin =

In order for the Registrations for the Events Calendar to work properly, you need to install its parent plugin, [The Events Calendar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/). (Both are free.)

= Quick to Set Up and Easy to Get Started =

As soon as you install and activate the plugin, you can begin collecting registrations. You don't need any shortcodes (although they're available). Instead, the registration form is automatically added to every single event page by default.

= User-Friendly Features =

* Reduce incomplete registrations by limiting the entire process to a single page (AJAX form submit).
* Keep your event page uncluttered (your registration form is hidden initially and revealed by clicking a customizable "Register" button).
* Follow-up with your attendees with a customizable confirmation email.
* Save entries in a database table for easy event management.
* Attendees can unregister (cancel registration) using a link sent in an email.

= Highly Customizable =

* Add as many text fields as you'd like to the registration form.
* Add the registration form to one of several parts of the page your event is displayed on.
* Display the registration form anywhere on your site with shortcodes.
* Customize the labels, error messages, directions for your attendees, and which fields are required.
* Customize both the email templates sent to your attendees and the notification email sent to the event holder.
* Limit the number of registrations per event.
* Display a list of current registered attendees.
* Specify a registration deadline (both date and time).

= Powerful Backend Features for Easy Management =

* Registrations are saved in the WordPress database, where you can manually add, edit, and delete them.
* Email addresses can be checked for duplicates (this prevents duplicate registrations).
* Get notifications when new registrations need to be reviewed.
* View a breakdown of registrations by event, and browse them quickly in an overview.
* Export your registrations to a CSV spreadsheet.
* Search registrations by name, phone, or email.

= Benefits =

* Simple workflow frees up your time.
* Customizations allow you to add a personal touch.
* Optional display of a registered attendee list builds community.
* Straightforward registration process provides a world-class user experience.

= Feature Reviews =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I limit the number of registrations for an event? =

Yes. You can set up the maximum number of registrants on the "Form" tab or set this for each event individually.

= Can I add more fields to the form? =

Yes. There is a button to add custom text input fields on the "Form" tab.

= How do I disable registrations for a specific event? =

By default, registrations are enabled for every event. You can disable registrations for a specific event by checking the appropriate box on the "Edit Event" page or on the "Registrations" tab "Overview" page. You can also disable registrations by default by checking the checkbox on the "Form" tab.

= Can I set a deadline for when registrations are accepted? =

You can configure an offset for how long registrations will be available relative to the event start time or set a specific deadline for each event.

= Can I edit registrations and export them for an event? =

Yes. Click on the button "Detailed View" for the event in which you'd like to edit or export registrations for.

= Can I display a list of event attendees on the front-end? =

Yes. There is an option on the "Form" tab to display a list of attendees above the registration form. A guest's first and last name will only appear after you have had a chance to review it in the backend of the site.

= Can I display the registration form on another page or post? =

Yes. You would need to use the post ID for that event in the shortcode. Example: [rtec-registration-form event=743]

= The form is not hidden initially. Why is that? =

It's likely that you have a javascript error somewhere on that page. Try disabling other plugins or switching themes to see if this corrects the issue.

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress multisite? =

The plugin is not yet fully compatible with a WordPress multisite installation. It will be soon! Please contact us if you are interested in using the plugin with multisite.

= What do I do if I have a request or need help? =

Go to the "Support" tab on the plugin's settings page and follow the link to our support page, setup instructions page, or feature request page.
